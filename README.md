# FractalRender
Outputs a video that shows a graph of a fractal. The 'camera' zooms slowly into the fractal. Many of the properties of the video and fractal can be modified by using the options. The output can take a long time to render, it uses millions of inefficient calculations. Matlab was chosen as an excercise and proof-of-concept. Ideally another language would be chosen such as Python or C++ which would allow for some magnitues faster render time.
## Usage
Download entire project and run FractalRender.m. Modify options within FractalRender.m to get desired results.
## Example
What a single output frame may look like.
